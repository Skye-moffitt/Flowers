    <p>For the final page, you should create an order form that customers can complete online.  Note that you are designing the front end of the form, not the back end.  You should use appropriate form fields, but the final form will not be connected to an actual database.

        To place an order for any of our products, or to request our latest catalog, complete the form below.
        
        Name
        
        Email Address
        
        Phone Number
        
        Shipping Address (NOTE: use separate fields for street address, city, state and zip)
        
        Include the pot names as a drop-down, and a text box for the quantity.
        
        Frannie would like to find out more about her customers.  Include a series of radio buttons that asks if the customer's Gardening Skill is an amateur, hobbyist or professional.
        
        Close with a series of checkboxes that asks the customer if they would like to receive an email newsletter and/or a catalog.
        
        Finish with buttons to submit and to clear the form.<p/>
